# **TextureGenerator**

**TextureGenerator** is a Python-based tool designed for modders who need to generate custom textures for wood or ore sets in Minecraft. It simplifies the creation of these textures by automating the process.

## Features
- Automatically generates textures for Minecraft wood and ore sets.
- Simple to use and set up.
- Customizable to suit modders' needs.

## Installation

To run **TextureGenerator**, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Step 1: Clone the repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TextureGenerator.git
```

## Step 2: Install dependencies
This project uses `Pillow` and `tkinter` for generating and managing textures. Install the required libraries by running the following commands:

```
pip install pillow
pip install tkinter
```

Additionally, the project uses `os`, but it's a part of Python's standard library, so no installation is necessary.

## Usage

1) Navigate to the folder where you have cloned **TextureGenerator**.
2) Run the `main.py` file. This can be done from your terminal or command prompt:
```
python main.py
```
3) After some prompts regarding textures, the textures will be generated and saved in the `generated` folder located in the same directory as `main.py`.
